# Queues

A Queue is a FIFO data structure.  The first element added to the Queue is the first element removed from the Queue.

There are two primary operations on a Queue:
- Enqueue: add an element to the back of the Queue.
- Dequeue: remove the front-most element from the Queue and return it.

A few other operations that may be supported are:
- Peek: return the front-most element from the Queue without removing it.
- Size: return the number of elements in the Queue.
- IsEmpty: return True if the Queue is empty, False otherwise.
