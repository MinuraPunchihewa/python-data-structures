# Linked List

A Linked List is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. 

The entry point to a Linked List is called the head. The head is not a separate node, but rather a reference to the first node in the sequence.

The last node in the sequence is called the tail. The tail node's pointer points to `None`.

There are two types of Linked Lists:
- Singly Linked List: each node only has a pointer to the next node in the sequence.
- Doubly Linked List: each node has a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node in the sequence.
