# Stacks

A Stack is a LIFO data structure.  The last element added to the Stack is the first element removed from the Stack.

There are two primary operations on a Stack:
- Push: add an element to the top of the Stack.
- Pop: remove the top-most element from the Stack and return it.

Another operation that is often supported is Peek: return the top-most element from the Stack without removing it.
