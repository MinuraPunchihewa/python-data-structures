# Deques

A Deque is a double-ended queue.  It is a data structure that supports insertion and deletion at both the front and back of the queue. Therefore, it is neither a FIFO nor a LIFO data structure, but a hybrid of the two.

The programmer can enforce the behavior of the Deque (FIFO or LIFO) by only using the appropriate methods. Essentially, a Deque can be used as a Stack or a Queue.

The `collections` module in Python provides a `deque` class that implements a Deque. It is specifically optimized for fast (and memory-efficient) appends and pops from both ends.
